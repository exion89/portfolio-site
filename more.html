            <strong>My personal life</strong>
            <h2>I love to travel.</h2>
            <div class="about-text">
                <h3>Ever since I started watching <em>Anthony Bourdain</em> travel the world, trying exotic cuisine and making friends all over the planet,
                    I've been addicted to traveling. 
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Once I finally had enough money to leave the US, I first went to Italy in 2015. I stayed in 
                    cheap hostels and had tight budgets, but I immediately fell in love with traveling and my addiction soon continued...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Very soon after returning from Italy, I decided to go to Thailand. It was an unforgettable experience, and I can't wait to go back
                    to South East Asia.
                    I love all food from every culture on the planet. My favorite food is probably Thai food, however there's pretty much
                    nothing I won't eat. The US has the best food in the world because it's so diverse, and food is available from basically
                    every country and people on the planet. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A few countries later and I decided that I wanted to live outside of the US. Politically and socially, I had so many issues with 
                    trying to start a family America. I decided to start dating in Mexico and eventually in 2018 fell in
                    love with my wife, Veronica. On October 22, 2022 we welcomed a baby girl named Renata Madison.
